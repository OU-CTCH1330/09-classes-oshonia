# 09 Domain classes

## Concept
- Model universe as human brain does
- Domain class = state (data) + behavior
- Internal state, consistency, invariant (roster cap vs roster count example)
- Encapsulation, public interface (declarations in header), private implementation (definitions in cpp)
  - Access labels
  - Constructor
- Class design vs class instance
  - Static members
- Enumerations  

## Syntax
- Class definition
- Declaring and initiating variable of a given class type
- Instance member access notation from outside, direct reference from inside
- Static member access notation
- Operator overloading



## Assignment overview

### New code
Three new classes in `domain`

### Unit testing
- New test tasks
- New debug configurations
- Tests: `test/test.cpp`
  - Idea of unit tests, isolated development and testing
  - Sandbox
  - Todo

### On the side
- Passing by reference vs passing by value: search student by id
- Review: namespaces
- Review: header files vs implementations
  - `include`
  - Declaration
  - Definition/implementation
